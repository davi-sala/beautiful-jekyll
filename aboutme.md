My name is Davi Sala. I have the following qualities:

- I'm in love with machine learning, data science, games and robots
- I rock a great mustache
- I'm a homebrewer by hobby

What else do you need?

### work experience

**jan-curr.17** - Software developer at [_PixForce_](pixforce.com.br), creating Machine Learning, 
data analysis and image processing solutions to UAV imagery.
Mainly using Python ML tools with the Tensorflow backend and OpenCV for computer vision.

**feb-dec.17** - Professor at [_SATC University_](www.faculdade.satc.edu.br/), located in Crici√∫ma, SC (Brazil).
Teaching the classes of _Applied Artificial Intelligence_, _Introduction to Robotics_, and _Embedded Systems_.

### education

In 2017 I finished my Masters in Electrical Engineering, in the area of _Control and Automation_ at the 
Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ([UFRGS](www.ufrgs.br/english)), where I developted a Liquid State Machine system for Z axis positioning control of the endpoint (tool) used by the BAXTER Robot while performing a trajectory on the X and Y axis.
This work resulted in a paper published at the IEEE I2MTC Conference [10.1109/I2MTC.2017.7969728](https://doi.org/10.1109/I2MTC.2017.7969728)


My BsC of Computer Engineering was completed in 2015 at the State University of Rio Grande do Sul ([UERGS](www.uergs.edu.br/)).
During undergraduation I participated on several projects conducted within the university, all of them using Machine Learning and Image Processing, where my passion began.
